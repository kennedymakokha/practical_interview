 Hosted on vercel https://practical-interview-frontend.vercel.app/

 This project consists of two main parts:

Frontend - Built with Next.js (React framework).
Backend - Built with Node.js (Express).
This guide will walk you through setting up both the frontend and the backend locally.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or later)
Download and install Node.js

npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn (optional)

Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
2. Setup Backend (Node.js)
The backend is an Express app that handles API requests.

Step 1: Install dependencies
Navigate to the backend directory and install the required dependencies.

bash
Copy
cd backend
npm install
Step 2: Configure environment variables
Ensure you have an .env file with the necessary environment variables for your backend (e.g., database URL, API keys, etc.). Example .env:

makefile
Copy
DB_URL=your-database-url
PORT=8000
Step 3: Start the backend server
Run the backend server using the following command:

bash
Copy
npm run dev
By default, the server will run on http://localhost:8000.

3. Setup Frontend (Next.js)
The frontend is a Next.js app that interacts with the backend API.

Step 1: Install dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies.

bash
Copy
cd frontend
npm install
Step 2: Configure environment variables
Ensure you have an .env.local file with the necessary environment variables for your frontend (e.g., API URL).

Example .env.local:

bash
Copy
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
Step 3: Start the frontend server
Run the Next.js development server:

bash
Copy
npm run dev
By default, the frontend will run on http://localhost:3000.

4. Accessing the Application
Once both servers are running:

Frontend: Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the frontend.
Backend: The API can be accessed at http://localhost:8000/api/v1.
5. Optional: Use Yarn (if preferred)
If you prefer using Yarn over npm, you can replace the npm commands with their Yarn equivalents:

bash
Copy
yarn install       # To install dependencies
yarn start         # To start the backend
yarn dev           # To start the frontend
6. Troubleshooting
Ensure that the backend is running and accessible before starting the frontend.
Check that you have the correct environment variables set for both frontend and backend.
Make sure there are no port conflicts if you're running other services locally.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you should have both the Next.js frontend and the Node.js backend running locally. If you have any issues or need further assistance, feel free to reach out!
